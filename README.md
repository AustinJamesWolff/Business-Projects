# Business-Projects
Code built for real-world businesses while freelancing (private data is scrubbed, obviously, and I have been given permission to share).

The Company_CRM_Unscrambling_Records.ipynb Google Colab file details a data science project in which I had to uncover how many contacts had their contact information swapped with each other and furthermore overwrite the old data with the correct data.
