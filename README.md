Code built for real-world businesses while freelancing (private data is scrubbed, obviously, and I have been given permission to share).

The Company_CRM_Unscrambling_Records.ipynb Google Colab file details a data science project in which I had to help fix a company's CRM data that was somehow corrupted under-the-radar during an import many months ago, making it too late to simply "undo" or "delete and reupload." I had to uncover how many contacts had their contact information swapped with each other and furthermore overwrite the old data with the correct data. Most of the work involved determing how to discover what contact information was swapped, how many contacts this happened to, how many contacts were interlinked due to this bug, and how to safely overwrite the correct data while not disturbing any other customer data.
